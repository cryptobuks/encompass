# Release 0.6.0

 * Bug-Fixes
   - Addresses with the correct version will now be shown when importing keys.
   - The known private key for a multisig address can now be shown in the GUI.
   - Numerous daemon-mode bugs have been fixed.

 * Multisig wallets now use a different key derivation path that allows multi-coin multisig
 wallets to be used, while only requiring that master public keys be shared once.

 ** NOTICE: As a result, Encompass multisig wallets are no longer BIP-44 compatible. **

 * Chainkey improvements
   - Chainhooks: Allow chains to 'hook' into functions, very similarly to how plugins
   do.
   - The hash algorithms used for transaction hashing and in base58 encoding can now
   be specified on a per-chain basis.
   - The base class `CryptoCur` now has generic implementations for some of the methods
   required in chainkey modules.

 * GUI improvements
   - The "Change Currency" dialog now has more information. Its verbosity can be set
   in the settings.
   - Some chains may be specified as "favorites" - these chains appear before others in
   the currency selection dialog.
   - The main window's tabs now have icons.
   - There are now icons for all chains. The active chain's icon is displayed in the status bar.
   - Specified chains can be hidden from the currency selection dialog.

 * Theme System: Themes for the lite window have been removed. Themes now apply to the
 entire program. Themes can be installed by placing them in the application data
 folder "themes". A theme that demonstrates the new customization capabilities is included.
 It's called "Terminal" and provides a green-on-black color scheme.

 * M-of-N Multisig: Arbitrary M-of-N multisig wallets are now creatable. M and N are limited
 by the size of the input scripts they would create. The function `is_standard_mofn(m,n)`
 in `bitcoin.py` calculates whether they are acceptable.

 * Daemon code has been updated with upstream Electrum's improvements.

 * Plugin code has been updated with upstream Electrum's improvements.

 * Network-related code has been updated with upstream Electrum's improvements.

 * A new plugin, "Auto History Export," automatically exports the wallet's history when
 a transaction is received, as well as doing so on command.

 * There can now be plugins that are "hidden." These plugins are not visible to the user,
 and are always considered "enabled" if their requirements are met. Their purpose is to allow
 more unique features of certain chains to be used.

 * New daemon commands:
   - dumpconfig: Outputs the section of the config file for the active chain.
   - listchains: Outputs a list of blockchains that Encompass supports.
   - getheader: Retrieves a block header for a given height, optionally deserialized.
   - allownossl: Convenience command to allow non-SSL server connections.

 * Support for new blockchains
   - Blackcoin
   - Clam
   - Dogecoin
   - Feathercoin
   - Groestlcoin
   - Namecoin
   - Peercoin

 * Dependencies for various hash algorithms are now consolidated into one package, coinhash,
 which is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip.

 * Backwards-compatible refactoring has been done to improve encapsulation.
   - Script-related code is now in `script.py` (from `transaction.py`)
   - ECDSA code is now in `eckey.py` (from `bitcoin.py`)
   - Base58-related code is now is `base58.py` (from `bitcoin.py`)
   - Coin-related utilities like `var_int()` are now in `util_coin.py` (from `util.py`)

 * DER signatures in transactions are now always canonical.

 * User config is now stored as formatted JSON, rather than a JSON string.

 * Several functions are now documented.

# Release 0.5.0

 * Produce Linux,OSX,Windows binary releases
 * Implement Trezor Hardware wallet 
   - trezor wallets are supported on all chains
   - custom firmware is required to access chains not supported in official firmware form Trezor
 * Implement Multisignature wallets
   - Primary multisig wallet type in Encompass is based on an as-yet draft BIP
     - Encompass-multisig supports a single root key to derive addresses on all chains
 * Chain-specific WIF version bytes now used
 * Installation & Build Enhancements
   - build system is updated to include building OSX and Linux binary release packages
   - setup.py and setup-release.py modified to support user installation, sandbox building/installs
 * Bug-Fixes
   - o not include next_account address in wallet.addresses()
   - via - disable diff calc (use not implemented) 
 * Update icons 

# Release 0.4.4
 
 * Fixes issues with password encryption of seed & master privkeys
   - previous versions would only correctly update the encryption of the active chain
   - this could result in seed and/or master privkeys being unencrypted
   - this version will correct old wallets, however users are advised to move funds if leaking deleted data is a concern
   - more details available on https://maza.club/encompass

 * Implements updated Change Currency dialog, now shows status of PoW checks being done in ChainKey module, and
   number of servers listed in the module. 

 * Makes Windows releases more deterministic - specifies all dependencies in make_packages, resolves issues with requests module
